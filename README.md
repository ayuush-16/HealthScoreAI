## 🤖 Use of AI
We want to be transparent that we took **some help from AI tools** (for example, in building parts of the complex backened code of python and some part of the frontend website we use Chatgpt, for slides templates we use Gamma).  
However:
- **All the ideas are originally ours.**
- AI helped us **improve and speed up development**, just like using any other modern tool.
- In today’s **AI era**, it is not only acceptable but **smart to leverage AI** to become better learners and developers.
