## Quick Start

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Windows)
```bash
start_server.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Install Tesseract OCR** (for image processing)
```bash
winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR
```

3. **Run the Application**
```bash
python app.py
```

4. **Open in Browser**
Navigate to: http://localhost:5000

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_app.py
```

This will test all file types (CSV, PDF, Images) and verify OCR functionality.

## Sample Files

The `sample_files/` directory contains example health reports:
- `health_report.csv` - Standard health report with normal ranges
- `comprehensive_health_report.csv` - Complete biomarker set (16+ parameters)
- `mixed_optimal_report.csv` - Mix of optimal and non-optimal values
- `high_risk_report.csv` - High-risk patient data (triggers multiple conditions)
- `optimal_health_report.csv` - Excellent health indicators
- `optimal_health_comprehensive.csv` - All biomarkers at optimal levels
- `report_2023.csv` - Historical health data (2023)
- `report_2024.csv` - Recent health data (2024)
- `health_report_image.png` - Sample image for OCR testing
- `health_report.txt` - Text-based health report

**Multiple File Testing**: Upload `report_2023.csv` and `report_2024.csv` together to see collective analysis in action!

## Troubleshooting

### Image Processing Issues
If you encounter issues with image processing:

1. **Install Tesseract OCR:**
   ```bash
   # Windows (using winget)
   winget install UB-Mannheim.TesseractOCR
   
   # Windows (manual)
   # Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   # Install to: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\
   
   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
   
   # macOS
   brew install tesseract
   ```

2. **Verify Tesseract installation:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   "C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe" --version
   
   # Linux/macOS  
   tesseract --version
   ```

3. **Check image quality:**
   - Use high-resolution images (at least 300x300 pixels)
   - Ensure text is clearly readable
   - Use good contrast (dark text on light background)
   - Avoid blurry or skewed images

4. **Alternative formats:**
   - CSV format works best and is most reliable
   - PDF format also works well for text-based documents

### General Issues
If you encounter "code language not supported" error:
1. Ensure Tesseract OCR is properly installed
2. Run `start_server.bat` for automated setup
3. Run `python test_app.py` to verify all components

## Notes

- Maximum file size: 10MB
- All analysis rules are hard-coded for hackathon demo purposes
- Sample data will be used if no biomarkers are detected in uploaded files
- This is for educational/demo purposes only - not for actual medical diagnosis
